// QA Pre Interview Assessment Exercise for BAE Training Scheme
//Define the following key Object Orientated Programming (OOP) principles with examples:
//These concepts will be discussed further if you are invited to an assessment day.
//Exercise 1
//
//Encapsulation
//
//Inheritance
//
//Polymorphism
//
//Abstraction
//
//QA Cinemas is a well-known company in the Cinema industry that has been running since 1859. 
//Currently the company do all their ticket pricing manually, 
//and therefore, they want to commission an external party to build an electronic system 
//to replace this outdated manual process.
//
//You are required to create a simple prototype cinema system that provide the ability 
//to purchase tickets and return the total price of a customer’s order.
//Ticket prices for all movies at this cinema are as follows:
//
//Ticket prices:
//
//Standard - £8
//
//OAP - £6
//
//Student - £6
//
//Child - £4
//
//QA Cinemas also offers a discount each Wednesday where every ticket is £2 cheaper.
//
//For example, if a family consisting of a standard admission, a student and a child attended 
//an appropriate film showing on a Monday. The program would output something similar to the following:
//•
//The total cost of tickets for this movie is £18.
//
//You are required to create a java project that meets the requirements outlined above.
//We expect a minimum of 4 classes to be created and for you to utilise the concepts outlined in exercise 1.
//
//Both exercises should be submitted on Github for review. 
//Exercise 1 can be published as a text file, and exercise 2 by committing the relevant source code 
//to a Github repository.
